# 🌍 Multi-Modal Cross-Border Route Selector 🚛✈️🚢  

An **AI-powered logistics optimization tool** that determines the most efficient **cross-border shipping routes** using multiple transport modes (**air, sea, land, or hybrid combinations**). It optimizes key constraints like **cost, transit time, regulatory feasibility, and carbon footprint**.  

Developed during **LogiThon 2025 (IIT Bombay)**, this project leverages AI and geospatial data to enhance decision-making in logistics and supply chain management.
